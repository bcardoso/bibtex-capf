=bibtex-capf= provides a backend using Emacs's native =completion-at-point= function
for the completion of bibtex keys in modes used for prose writing. This backend
activates for citation styles used by =pandoc-mode= (@), =latex-mode= (\cite{}), and
=org-mode= (cite:@). This package is largely a port of =company-bibtex= to Emacs's
native completion framework. It works particularly well with [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]], which
enhances completion at point with a small completion popup.

:CUSTOM_ID: initialization

Load the package and add =bibtex-capf= to =capf-backends= (there is a
minor mode -- =bibtex-capf-mode= -- for easy activation and deactivation
of the capf) using use-package and straight:

#+begin_example
(use-package bibtex-capf
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "mclear-tools/bibtex-capf")
  :hook ((org-mode markdown-mode tex-mode latex-mode reftex-mode) . bibtex-capf-mode)
  :custom
  (bibtex-capf-bibliography
   '("path/to/bib/file.bib")))
#+end_example

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:END:
=bibtex-capf= reads from a bibliography file or files specified in
=bibtex-capf-bibliography=:

#+begin_example
(setq bibtex-capf-bibliography
    '("/home/cooluser/thesis/thesis1.bib"
      "/home/cooluser/thesis/thesi2.bib"))
#+end_example

Since this is Emacs, there are other ways to satisfy the user's need for
citation completion at point. Here are two notable ones:

- https://github.com/gbgar/company-bibtex
- https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar
